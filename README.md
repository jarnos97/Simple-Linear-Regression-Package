This package can be used to crate an OLS model and test its assumptions.
The function linear_model initializes an Ordinary Least Squares Linear Regression model and fits it to data.
The linear regression has 5 assumptions (linearity, no (or little) multicollinearity, normality, no autocorrelation,
homoscedasticity). Each assumptions has an eponymous function to test the assumption. In addition, a simple function to
remove outliers in added as a seperate function.
